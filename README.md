This repository contains the source code for the DSA5104 project of Group 11, named "NULL." The project involves processing raw data from the [Amazon product dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html), provided by the data source.

## Code Organization

- **CodesDataProcessing**: This directory stores Python code for processing the original dataset into various CSV files.

- **create_database.sql**: This file stores SQL commands for creating MySQL tables and loading data into them.

## Database Queries

- **MySQLqueries.sql**: This file contains eight queries designed for use with the MySQL database.

- **MongoDBqueries.txt**: This file contains queries for interacting with a MongoDB database.

## Application Code

- **searchweb**: This directory holds code for the frontend and backend of the application. It encapsulates queries and MySQL database interactions into a web application.

- **vue**: This directory contains code related to the frontend of the application using Vue.js.

## Usage

1. **Data Processing**: Execute the Python scripts in the `CodesDataProcessing` folder to process the raw dataset into CSV files.

2. **Database Setup**: Use the `create_database.sql` file to set up the MySQL tables and load data into them.

3. **Queries**: Execute the queries in `MySQLqueries.sql` for MySQL database interactions and refer to `MongoDBqueries.txt` for MongoDB queries.

4. **Application**: Explore the `searchweb` folder for the frontend and backend code, integrating queries and database functionality into an application. The `vue` folder contains the Vue.js frontend code.
